Prolog
Life was always harsh for me.

As the youngest son of a local count, I should enjoy all the privileges associated with my financial situation ... Unfortunately, in fact I felt worse than a swineherd. First of all, I was physically unlike my father or two older brothers, ugly, small, frail. Throughout my childhood, I was suspected of being a bastard, and because of that my mother preferred to stay away from me, as if I were an incriminating evidence of infidelity. I was not even allowed to stay in the representative rooms of our manor.

Secondly, I had no illusions that one of my brothers would got the rights to manage our possesion. Resourceful, intelligent, reasonable... What's worse, they had no problems with women who usually treated me like air. Certainly finding a wife for them would be a matter of a few days, and these would happily give them sons who would pull another branch of our family tree. I suppose that I would be wandering around the country as a poor nobleman without a land.

That's why I began to explore the secrets of magic, especially the dark and cursed. The talent for color manipulation also wasn't given to me, however, you did't need talent for the art of Septivium, knowledge and self-denial are enough. I have disappeared from the halls of our court to sketch patterns in the nearby barrow and study books forbidden in many lands. Books describing the recall of demons.

When all three moons were in their full shape, when I draw all the patterns and lit all the candles, a beautiful, sensual woman appeared in a cloud of smoke. In exchange for my immortal soul, she promised to fulfill my one wish. I did't have to think for a long time, this order could give everything which my fate took away from me - strength, charisma, wealth, power...

'I want to become one of you, make me a vampire.' - I said. After these words, the world swirled and darkness fell.

Some time after transformation, my older brother had to go on a long journey, driven by the overwhelming need to experience the adventure and cover himself with glory. Immediately after him, the second received a visiom from the Dragon of Everything, the lord and father all of us, to give up his temporal life and become a saintly hermit. Their sudden and unexpected disappearance was a great blow to my father, who declined on health and few years later said "goodbye" to the world. Just a moment after him, our mother died of grief.

The flowers on their graves did't even fade when I proclaimed myself the master of nearest area. Shortly after that, I dismissed all the service to make some improvements in my appearance and condition without arousing suspicions. The next 60 years were filled with laught, drunkenness and vulgar laughter. I played a party after the party, ball after ball, hunting after hunting, wanting to pay back those years of social rejection, which i experienced in my childhood. From time to time, I was visited by Arrainot's servants, who reminds me that as a vampire I had duties to the Hell, but I choosed to ignore them, with a charming smile asking for another loan from their treasury. I could live for ages more... if only this one damned night, didn't happend.

I knew I will triumph. Their dirty faces looked at me with dumb horror. Twenty to one? This is an unhonour fight - drank with blood i was faster than the cobra and stronger than aurochs. I didn't plan to organize a massacre... Only a small lesson, a few broken houses, a few new tombstones on a cemetery would be enough. In the end, these poor peoples provided revenue in my lands.

Unfortunately, I did not expect one - when Holly days of skimming fields were celebrated in last week, which I preferred to ignore at the bottom of the glass, the dragon priest allowed himself to sacrifice agricultural tools as a sign of good harvest in the future. Most of the weapons cannot touch my skin, not like one, which was ealier blessed... My smile curled into a grimace of dread when I felt a sharp pain in my chest - fast and short.

After it there was only darkness and coldness.

1.woke up
(old dialogue 1)
Marvo: Where ... where am I? My. Head. I feel ... so empty inside. Ugh.
They buried me somewhere? It looks like an abandoned mine. I have to get out of there.

2. Exit from a dark tunnel to place with lava
(old dialogue 8)
Marvo: It's hot here, but my skin is still cool and dry. One more moment and I will boil here alive ...

3. fight with nasnas
Marvo: Oh, nasnas. Immediately explain to me what's going on here.
Nasnas: Wriaa !!! Hmwrrr ...
Marvo: Wild nasnas? Interesting...

4. First entrance to any observation point
Marvo: I have to say, that the area looks impressive, and at the same time arouses strong anxiety inside me.

5. Entrance to the bridge leading to the island of Nasnas
The guard of the island of the nasnas: Hey, you right there. Have you seen nasnas, slave?
Marvo: I have seen many nasnas, and I see more behind you. And besides, I'm not a slave.
Guardian of the island of the nasnas: unfortunately, it looks like u are. Go ahead, you are useless here.
Marvo: What a impertinence! If I had my sword, you won't be here anymore.
Guard of the island of the nasunas: ...
Marvo: dumb.

6. Entrance to the observation point above the island of the nasnas
Marvo: Oh, bridge. I wonder how to get there and where it leads.

7. fight the first devil
(old dialogue 4)
Marvo // ALT: A man should not have so many eyes! Neither mouth, nor .. bleh, I won't give a comment to that.

8. Meeting with the handless
(old dialogue 6)
Marvo // ALT: You! No! Go away from me! Go away, I said!
Armlessness: Hmmm ... slave who escaped? And what are you doing so far away from the manufactory? I will have to report it ...
Marvo // ALT: I'm not slave! Wait ... have I been sold ?! Where am I?!!
Armless: Oh. I understand. You certainly feel very confused now. But you should expect it. Everything was in the cyrograph
Marvo: ...
Marvo: Am I in Hell?
Armories: The correct name of this place is Arrainot, the land of grief, but "Hell" is easier to remember. Yes, you died, and now under your contract your shell has joined us here, below.
Marvo: Nononononono... This is NOT HAPPENING. I can not sit down here with monsters. It's just bad dream. Wait ... I'll wake up soon and everything will be fine!
Armlessness: You call us monsters although you do not look better. It's unkind.
Marvo // ALT: What's up ... My face! That's awful! I look like a nightmare!
Armlessness: Calm down and listen - I am going to move you out of here, to the nearest city. These tunnels aren't safe. And then ... then we'll see.

9. Entrance to the bridge to the fields of devils
Marvo: Oh, devil. Quite a lot of them here. Their tendency to take strange shapes will never stop to amaze me.
Armlessness: Just do not approach the guards, landing in a lava can be quite unpleasant.

10. Slippage of the earth
Marvo // ALT: AAAA !!!
Marvo: Did you see it?
(a - when the armless is in front of the rift)
Armlessness: It happens, I call someone who needs to know it and someone will repair it or dig a new tunnel. For now, we will go around. And watch out where are you putting steps in the future
(b - when the armless is behind the rift)
Armlessness: It happens, I call someone who needs to know it and someone will repair it or dig a new tunnel. For now, we will go around. And watch out where are you putting steps in the future

11. Another clash with devil (next to it stands nasnas)
Marvo: You look just like those village girls ... Disgusting. 
Are there any beautiful women in this cruel world !?
Handless: You have the requirements ...
Nasnas: Uaaa! Run!
(nasnas escapes)

12.Enter the bridge to the CHOCHLIKÓW or at least in this area
Guardian of nest 1: And see what you've done? You catched this nasnas, but the CHOHLIKI had run away. Are you happy with yourself?
Guardian of nest 2: So why didn't you watch over them? That's why there are three of us to watch them.
Guardian of nest 1: And because I have to watch for them all?
Guardian of nest 3: What's up?
Guardian of nest 1: Dhre'val released imps.
Guardian of nest 2: I did not let the imps go! It was Seghr'ghral who let them escape.
Guardian of nest 3: Shut up, idiots! I would order now both of u to chase after these CHOHLIKI, but I will not stand here and watch over only by myself. You are going to stand here and guard. Make sure the CHO won't run away again. It really isn't a complicated task. How many times it will be necessary to explain you that?
Marvo: Oho, fuss.
Armlessness: You better not interfere, or they'll set you up to release these CHO. Chasing after them is the best what would happend to you after such an accusation.

13a. fight with a CHO if Marvo was walking first
Marvo // ALT: Ugh! What is ... What is it! Fuck off  from me! Go away!
Armlessness: Such a brave man and hadn't even saw imp before?

13b.
Armlessness: Well, excellent, we found him quickly.

14. Entering the fork area
Armlessness: We're almost there ...

Armless:...
Armlessness // ALT: What ?!

armless // ALT: A small nasty flying creature! He is sitting and closing! I'll make sure he regrets it! Go look around for the guards.


15.
Armlessness // ALT: Flying scum. I'll get you!
16a. 
Marvo: This lava river seems to be long as Hell ... Amazing, fantastic, wonderful! Oh, bow. I'll take it for myself. If i'd found arrows for it, i could use it to kill that little piece of shit on the opposite bank of river!
16b.
Marvo: This lava river seems to go on forever ... Amazing, fantastic, wonderful! Oh, there is a bow. I ll take it!

17a.
Marvo: CHO is blocking the passage by closing the bridge.
Guardian of the cave 1: If your master cannot pass, why do not you help him yourself? Go beat that imp or something. I don't have the equipment to do it.
Marvo: I have a bow, but I don't have arrows.
Cave guard 2: Oh, this is Erg'ech's bow. He will be surprised. Maybe we should broke ot? Why the bow for him?
The cave guard 1: I do not know. I think he took it as a booty from the surface. Have you ever shot a bow?
Cave guard 2: No, never. Let's go check on this CHochlik.
The cave guard 1: No, no, no. I'm going to check and you're staying here and watching.
Cave guard 2: Grhmfp.

Armlessness // ALT: Well, finally! Shoot that imp, guard! There are some shots. Right there.

Armlessness: Well, finally.
Marvo: Well, he took a bow. Sigh ...
17b.
Marvo: A goblin blocking the passage by closing the bridge.
Guardian of the cave 1: If your master cannot pass, why don't you help him by yourself? I do not have the equipment to do it. I would need something to shoot him. Go take care of it, slave.
Marvo: I'm not ...

18a.

Armlessness // ALT: Where have you been?! There are no guards down here, they are in the other direction.
Marvo: You would go and look after them by yourself.
Armlessness // ALT: GO, DUMB!
Marvo: Okay, okay.
18b.
Cave guard 1: I think, I should take care of it. Oh, I see you have an Erg'ech bow.
Armlessness: Hurry up, I want to have this imp's head! Here are some arrows.
Armlessness: Well, finally.
Marvo: Well, he took a bow. Sigh ...

19. 
Guardian of passage 1: And where are you going, slave?
Armlessness: He is just going inside.
Guardian of passage 1: Today is an important event. Slaves don't have permission to wander around the city.
Armlessness: What is it today, a bunch of morons? Nosense, what will I care about? Just take care of yourself, we are already in the guarded area, right at the entrance to the city.

Marvo: Just great.

20. 
The track guard 3: Hey! Slave! It's not the way.
Marvo: But they do not let me move through the entrance.
The track guard 3: What's up, they put only the idiots on guard today? HEY, YOU THERE! LET HIM PASS! AND WE'LL TALK ABOUT THIS LATER! And what are you doing. Still standing here? It's not a place for slaves, move on!.
21. 
Armlessness: Oh, I see you caught up with me. There is a city in front of us - Irxerivethg. In Arrainot, it isn't safe anywhere, but here at least you can take a break.
Marvo: Iks ... Irkse ... It does not matter. What's up? What did you do in these tunnels?
Armlessness: I was returning from a friend, the owner of a plantation of rotten wood. Usually, this place is a little bit calmer. And you... mindless ...
Marvo: I'm Marvo... My name is Marvo.
Armories: Here, the mindless like you have to deserve for their names. You will probably get a nickname or number when an owner will buy you.
Marvo: Really...? And you have any name?
Armlessness: You are funny devil. Of course I have. My name is Anuhvarran.
Marvo: Amhrv ...
Marvo: ... beautiful, I think so.
Armlessness: Hihihih, really, really funny. I like you. One more moment and I'd consider purchasing you.
Marvo: ...
Armlessness: With that bare-chested face you look more stupid than normal. I thought that's impossible. Let's move on, you have to be registered. Also I dont want to have any problems with that.
---

??
Marvo: I ... die?
?
Armlessness: Anyway, it looks that you're worthless There is nothing more, die... And see you within milion years. ...
??
Marvo: No! Don't leave me ... Don't leave alone ... please!




III


It wasn't a city.
I saw in my life many rich, poor, great and small, noble and full of crime. This one isn't like any of them.
Everything there was done without the help of an idea or even a plan, just as blind man had drawn his patterns on card of paper. Houses seemed to be alive, following me with galleries and windows. Carefully observing my every move with their doors. I wanted to move, but I wasn't able to control my body. I wanted to run away, just like a coward between enemies. I felt like snow-white sheep inside the circle of hungry wolfes. Thankfully there were him. I.. Ivarx... Armless. We moved our steps to the center, where a few well-dressed demons had already gathered.



 I don't know why, but I felt that I have been sleeping a while under the podium, where were sitting very disgusting creature with a hammer. Quickly, my role here became painfully bright.

D: Silence! Silence, silence, silence! We are starting auction no. 85. The mindless! Turn back boy, please. And stop hunches so much. Good impression is the basic!
M: I ... but ...

My body, agains my will, turned my face to the demons.
D: A young one which is presenting here, only 80 surface years, 189 cm higth, 71 kg weight. Healthy, white fangs ... Smile, young one! And stop hunching! I think you are worth some money, aren't you?!
M: Eeee ... Aye, aye ... Sir, yes ... Sir!

D: Silence! Silence, silence, silence! We are starting auction no. 85 on the plane of the involuntary. Turn away, boy, if you please and stop hunches so. A good impression of the foundation!
M: I ... but ...
Legs in my language turned to the demons.
D: A young specimen present here, suddenly 80 years of surface, 189 cm tall, 71 kg. Healthy, white fangs ... Smile! And stop hunching! I think you are worth something ?!
M: Eeee ... this is ... please ... sir
D: Sufficient power level, strong enough ... no more talking, show your hand!. You all can see that he is not a weakling - he will be suitable for harder works. Remember, that we are still dealing with the aristocracy.
 ... Mar ... vo Kanaiii (?) Dumb, strange surface names, nearly impossible to read.
(ANY DEMON 1): It's any pros, every second here was an aristocrat. The last one was scrapped - instead of work, only screamed and hid in the corners. Psychic piece of shit.
D: There are no psychological symptoms that cannot be cured with a stick or whip. And now, if you allow us, we'll start bidding.
(ANY DEMON 2): Wait! Is he Marvo Kanai? THIS Marvo Kanai?
M: Yes! Thank you! I told them that ...
(JD2): ... Mr. "we'll talk another time"? Mr. "could I ask for another loan"? Mr. "I'm not in the mood for similar activities, call tomorrow" ???
M // ALT: ... Excuse me?
(JD2) Oh, boy, I put one and a half gallons of tar on you right now. I will be happy to see how you explain yourself to your superiors before we put you on the madej bed and puts splinters under your filthy nails ...
M: Wait! I just wanted to ...!
(JD1): Two pots of tar!
(JD2): Two and a half pots!
D: Two and a half pots for the first time, two and a half pots ...
(JD1): Three pots of tar and ruby!
M: Will anyone want to hear me ?! It's mistake! PLEASE !!
(JD2): Five tar pots!
D: Five for the first time, five for the second time, five for ...
(JD3): Six pots and the same ounce of gold!
D: For the first, second and third time, sold to magnate general Huraxavirth!
(JD2): Fuck it !!!
M: ... Thanks the dragons!
Huraxavirth: No, but you are coming with me, mindless. I hope you have as much value as my friend assured me. You should be glad, that demon probably would eat you already... but I will give you prospects for the future. Just move faster!
M: Armless ... It must be he. Well, I'm glad, that i found an ally in place right this... at least right now.






















Misja 4
Genera³ H: S³uchajcie larwy mnie dobrze. Dzisiaj jest dzieñ, w którym bêdziecie mogli siê wykazaæ. W tej w³anie dolinie nast¹pi³ wypadek magiczny. Pojawili siê nieumarli.
Demon: Ale sk¹d nieumarli u nas, na dole? Przecie¿ jestemy
H: Niemiertelni? Byæ mo¿e. Jednak trupy jakie do nas dochodz¹ z powierzchni. Czarnoksiê¿nicy próbowali zaszczepiæ w nich zdobyte dusze u¿ywane do napêdzania fabryki. Te niestety zbuntowa³y siê, rozszarpa³y fizyczne pow³oki swych twórców i szalej¹. Jest ich coraz wiêcej.
Marvo: Nieumarli heor to zawsze by³ liski temat. Czemu nie u¿yli do tego czystej Czarnej Magii?
Marvo: Panie Generale.
H: Nie mêdrkuj tak, ch³opcze, nie jeste specjalist¹. Nie wiem co im tam siek³o. Doæ powiedzieæ, ¿e jest problem, a my, jako Straszliwe Kohorty Wyzwoleñcze Piekie³ musimy go rozwi¹zaæ! To bêdzie wietny test waszych umiejêtnoci i pokaz si³y naszej armii! 
H: Za mrok i za ogieñ!
Demony: Za siarkê i smo³ê!
Marvo: Wykazaæ siê, co? To mo¿e byæ moja szansa na ¿ycie lepsze ni¿ marne szorowanie pod³óg.
ZADANIA:
Dostañ siê Marvo do ruin fabryki
Marvo musi prze¿yæ
Genera³ musi prze¿yæ
Misja dzieli siê na dwa etapy  pierwszy etap typu przetrwanie. Si³y przeciwnika s¹ przewa¿aj¹ce, acz zarazem na tyle rozproszone, ¿eby manewrowanie miêdzy nimi by³o mo¿liwe. Marvo musi dostaæ siê do fabryki w centralno  po³udniowym fragmencie mapy. W miêdzyczasie pojawi siê subplot z Lullaby, która zapewne bêdzie wpl¹tana w ca³¹ sytuacjê.
Wariant dialogu  Marvo wchodzi pierwszy do ruin
Marvo: Okej, co teraz gdzie musi znajdowaæ siê ród³o tych wszystkich nieumar³ych
Upiór: Upodleni! Potêpieni! Wstañcie na moje wo³anie! Us³yszcie mój g³os!
Marvo(vr2): Hej ty! Co ty niby wyprawiasz, plebsie?
Upiór: Zwa¿ na s³owa, s³ugusie mroku! Kiedy zwa³em siê Dirraiel Straszliwy, by³em najpodlejszym z Czarnych Magów! Ca³e miasta pada³y na kolana przed moj¹!
Marvo: Gadanin¹? Zawartoci¹ rozporka? Dla kogo kierujesz ten cyrk? Jeste martwy, a ja dopilnujê, aby wróci³ grzecznie do s³oika, z którego ciê wypuszczono.
Wariant dialogu  Marvo wchodzi do ruin ju¿ po generale
Genera³ H: Poddaj siê, duchu i z³ó¿ broñ. I tak nie masz ju¿ nic do stracenia.
Marvo: Tak! Przestañ bawiæ siê w fabrykê trupów i poddaj siê!
Upiór: Zwa¿cie na s³owa, s³ugusy mroku! Kiedy zwa³em siê Dirraiel Straszliwy, by³em najpodlejszym z Czarnych Magów! Ca³e miasta pada³y na kolana przed moj¹ potêg¹!
Genera³ H: Nie obchodzi mnie kim by³e. Teraz jeste jedynie zasilaczem, ród³em paliwa i wrócisz do swojego filakterium.
Upiór: PRÊDZEJ ZDECHNÊ!
Marvo: Niefortunny dobór s³ów
Druga czêæ misji jest du¿o bardziej typowa, nale¿y po prostu zabiæ szefa truposzy.
